    It would be amazing if you guys could have a quick look at this intro to JavaScript  before next Saturday. It'll only take 15 minutes but introduces you to a few of the concepts like variables (not scary), "strings", and operators (again, not scary, it just means plus signs): https://www.javascript.com/try
    </p>
    
    I have listed a whole bunch of resources that we discussed, plus a few challenges. Before you get overwhelmed, this is all optional and I don't expect anyone to to go through all this!! It's just a list of resources. The challenges are to give you something to keep you learning and googling - again, do what you can and have time for.
    
    Feel free to email me with any questions, anything you get stuck on, any feedback from day 1, anything you want to touch on especially next week.

    A couple of games to help learn flexbox:
    -Flexbox froggy: http://flexboxfroggy.com/
    -or if action is more your thing, Flexbox defence: http://www.flexboxdefense.com/
    
    Specificity calculator, if you want to investigate which css rules override others: https://specificity.keegan.st/
    
    Codepen, for paying with html and css (and eventually js). I highly recommend signing up, it's free: https://codepen.io/
    
    An essential life changing expeience for any budding hacker is to listen to Richard Stallman's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sJUDx7iEJw">Free Software Song</a> in it's <strong>entirety</strong>.

    <ul>
      <li>A warning for all budding web devs: <a href="http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com">The Worst Website Ever</a>
      (there's a little link in there somewhere that lists all the errors)</li>
      <li> <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribble</a> is a great place to get design inspration</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/">Pinterest</a> can also be great. WHen making a design, you can create a board to keep ideas and inspirations in one place. You might also create a board for websites that have great design.</li>
      <li>A lot of web designers create a <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/make-a-mood-board/">mood board</a> as part of the design process. You can display your colors, fonts, logos.</li>
      <li>Don't forget to create mockups in Figma. You can play around to find something that works before you start to code. Just don't forget to keep in mind the constraints of HTML/CSS styling.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Some nice sites from bootcamp students that you can use for inspiration:

    <h2>CHALLENGES</h2> 
    (when doing these, you might like to play with them in codepen):
    - Sign up to a password manager!
    - Investigate (ie google) what a css reset is and implement it on your site
    - CSS hover effects are a great way to give feedback. Add one to your nav items
    - Make your hover effect a bit nicer by adding a css transition of around 0.3 second
