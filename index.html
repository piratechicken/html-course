    It would be amazing if you guys could have a quick look at this intro to JavaScript  before next Saturday. It'll only take 15 minutes but introduces you to a few of the concepts like variables (not scary), "strings", and operators (again, not scary, it just means plus signs): https://www.javascript.com/try
    </p>
    
    I have listed a whole bunch of resources that we discussed, plus a few challenges. Before you get overwhelmed, this is all optional and I don't expect anyone to to go through all this!! It's just a list of resources. The challenges are to give you something to keep you learning and googling - again, do what you can and have time for.
    
    Feel free to email me with any questions, anything you get stuck on, any feedback from day 1, anything you want to touch on especially next week.

    (when doing these, you might like to play with them in codepen):
    - Sign up to a password manager!
    - Investigate (ie google) what a css reset is and implement it on your site
    - CSS hover effects are a great way to give feedback. Add one to your nav items
    - Make your hover effect a bit nicer by adding a css transition of around 0.3 second

    - Use a google font (pick a font, follow the instructions, cut/paste): https://fonts.google.com/
    - Make your website responsive so that it reads well on mobile, tablet and desktop (google css breakpoints)
    - Make your nav items more "button-like" (don't use html button) and make the whole button clickable (with the hover effect and transition)
